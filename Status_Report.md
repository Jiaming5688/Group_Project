# Group Project Status Report
Project Title: The distribution characteristics of traffic safety events in Los Angeles

Link to Proposal: https://github.com/Jiaming5688/Group_Project/blob/main/Group_Project_Proposal.md 

## Roles
- **Jiaming Zhu:** Project Manager - Oversees project progress, ensures deadlines are met, and coordinates team communication.
- **Catherine Ren:** Data Analyst - Leads the analysis of traffic safety events, including GIS analysis and statistical validation.
- **Qingyang Xu:** Visualization Expert - Designs and creates visualizations, including interactive web maps and charts, to represent our findings clearly.
- **Kailong Ji:** GIS Specialist - Focuses on GIS data processing, map creation, and spatial analysis.
- **Yaofa Gong:** Data Scientist - Works on data sourcing, cleaning, and preparing datasets for analysis, including scripting for data manipulation.
  
## Status Update
### General Mood
The team is optimistic but acknowledges the workload ahead. There's a positive atmosphere, with members eager to contribute to the project's success.

### What's Working
Collaboration tools and communication channels are well-established, allowing for efficient teamwork. Initial data collection has been successful.

### What's Not
Balancing the workload with other academic commitments has been challenging for some members. There are also technical hurdles with some of the GIS analyses.

## Data Update
We have successfully gathered traffic safety event data from the Los Angeles Open Data and Transit Major Safety Events. Census data has been accessed to provide demographic and socioeconomic variables for correlation analysis.

### Data Sources
- [Los Angeles Open Data](https://data.lacity.org/browse )
- [Transit Major Safety Events](https://data.transportation.gov/Public-Transit/Major-Safety-Events/9ivb-8ae9/about_data)
- [2018-2022 Census Data](https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/ACS2022_5yr/R13567952)

## Concerns
### Major Concerns
- Meeting the project timeline given the complex analysis and potential technical issues.
- Ensuring accuracy and reliability of the data analysis, particularly with spatial joins and GIS processing.

### Minor Concerns
- Some team members are still scaling the learning curve with Python libraries and GIS tools.
- Coordinating schedules for group meetings due to differing time zones and commitments.
